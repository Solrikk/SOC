Reason for Classifying as False Positive: 
This email was flagged due to its metadata being processed for potential sensitive content. However, after review, the message is determined to be a legitimate business communication. The subject line references an interview request for a company spotlight article, which aligns with normal outreach behavior. Additionally, the following indicators support the false positive classification:
- The email has no attachment, minimizing the likelihood of phishing/malware.
- The content was removed in accordance with privacy/security policies, but no known indicators of compromise (IoCs) are present in the metadata.
- The sender and recipient domains appear legitimate and business-related.
- The direction is outbound, and there is no evidence of data exfiltration or suspicious payloads.
